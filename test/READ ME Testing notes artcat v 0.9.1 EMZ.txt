* specify all options at once
artcat, pc(0.2 0.5) pe(0.4 0.6) or(0.5) rr(0.5) power(.9) ologit ologit(NN) ologit(NA) ologit(AA) whitehead
* error message: option ologit() not allowed                                                                 
***** perhaps could be more helpful? ******************
For example: artcat: Too many options specified.  Please specify one of pe, or, rr.  Only one ologit() should be specified and whitehead is to be used with or() only.
Or just,...Too many options specified, look at the helpfile please?!!

* check incorrect specification with un/favourable and cumulative
artcat, pc(.6 .4 .2) rr(.5) margin(1.1) power(.9) probtable cum noround favourable
artcat, pc(.6 .4 .2) rr(.5) margin(1.1) power(.9) probtable cum noround unfavourable
* Error message: artcat: Non-positive probabilities found in pc  
***** to change to: with the cumulative option, probabilities in pc must be increasing *****


Known false assertions still listed in teting files (but addressed in the SJ paper)


No further comments on helpfile, looks great!

Paper
*****************

Pg 14, Testing section point 1.  Exact agreement achieved with Whitehead
Actually we have one case where artcat had a difference of 1 compared to Whitehead.
(* Example 3a Whitehead Paper pg 2267   // Artcat gives ss = 245 instead of Whitehead paper example of 244)
